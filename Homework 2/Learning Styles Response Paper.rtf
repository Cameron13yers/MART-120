\f0\fs24 \cf0 Learning Styles definitely affect how we learn. Learning styles mean that there are different styles of learning and the best or preferred style differs from person to person. One person\'92s best method of learning may not be as effective for another person, and this causes many different learning styles to have to be implemented in order to give one the best results of learning. I think everyone has a chance to learn at the same pace and level as each other,  but it depends on whether or not they use what learning styles they cater to.}
